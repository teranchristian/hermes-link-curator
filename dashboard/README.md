# Dashboard (link-curator)

FastAPI app that serves a read-only Obsidian-style web UI over a markdown vault.

## What it does

- **List** (`/`) — all entries, grouped by date, newest first
- **Calendar** (`/calendar`) — month view with entry-count heatmap
- **Search** (`/search?q=...`) — substring search across titles, summaries, tags
- **Tag pages** (`/tag/{tag}`) — entries for a specific tag
- **Day pages** (`/day/YYYY-MM-DD`) — entries for a specific day
- **Graph** (`/graph`) — D3 force-directed tag↔entry graph
- **Stats** (`/stats`) — JSON: total entries, days, type counts, top tags
- **Health** (`/health`) — JSON: server status + entry count

## How it finds the vault

Auto-discovery: the script computes the vault path as `<this-file>/../../vault`. So if you copy the dashboard to `<profile-dir>/dashboard/`, the vault is automatically `<profile-dir>/vault/`.

Override with `$HERMES_ARCHIVE_VAULT` if the vault lives somewhere else.

## Run

```bash
./start.sh 8090
# → open http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

The dashboard defaults to loopback and has no authentication. A non-loopback
`ARCHIVE_HOST` is rejected unless `ARCHIVE_ALLOW_REMOTE_BIND=1` is also set.
Keep it on loopback and use an SSH tunnel or an existing authenticated proxy for
remote access rather than exposing it directly.

All application scripts, styles, and fonts are local; D3 7.9.0 is vendored under
`static/vendor/`.

## Validate the vault

```bash
python3 validate.py
```

Checks every entry in `INDEX.md` for missing fields, malformed dates,
double-`---` separators, and other parse-breaking issues. It also reads canonical
dated notes to report `Shared by` values that differ only by normalization and
possible one-edit spelling variants. `INDEX.md` is deliberately excluded from
those cross-entry name comparisons so mirrored entries are not counted twice.
Validation reports issues without rewriting or merging archive entries. Run this
from inside the dashboard directory.

## Caching

The parser uses mtime-based invalidation: every request checks if `INDEX.md` was modified since last read. If yes, the cache rebuilds silently. The endpoint `GET /reload-cache` forces a manual refresh (rarely needed).
